### Hello 👋

👔 I have been a Data Science Intern at Zscaler for the past 10 months and have been working in a myriad of interesting applications of ML and DL in the space of cybersecurity. Thanks to the diverse kinds of problems I get to solve on a day-to-day basis here, I have had exposure to Knowledge Graph based methods, highly detailed feature engineering, using LLMs to integrate domain knowledge and many more interesting use cases.

🔭 Previously, while learning the broad field of Machine Learning, I have had the opportunity to deep dive into Computer Vision and NLP applications. I still love reading up papers from Generative Modelling (Continuous Normal Flows is the next thing on my list to learn) to NLP / LLM based use cases. I do like to always differentiate between NLP and LLM because of the sheer brute force approach of one over the other. 

🌱 In a past life, I have had experience with Full Stack Web Development with technologies like TypeScript, Vue, Docker, Git etc. Once in a while, I do still find myself in the midst of this landscape, when a project that has these requirements calls out my name.

👨🏻‍🎨 As a pastime, I do love reading science fiction and non-fiction novels. Please send me any recommendations if you have any.

⚽️ The "sport" that I have been interested in for about 10 years now is Counter Strike. The intricacies and the layers in the game are what have pulled me in.
